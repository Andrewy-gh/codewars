// Complete the function that accepts a string parameter, and reverses each word in the string. All spaces in the string should be retained.

// "This is an example!" ==> "sihT si na !elpmaxe"

// The goal of this exercise is to convert a string to a new string where each character in the new string is "(" if that character appears only once in the original string, or ")" if that character appears more than once in the original string. Ignore capitalization when determining if a character is a duplicate.
// Examples

// "din"      =>  "((("
// "recede"   =>  "()()()"
// "Success"  =>  ")())())"
// "(( @"     =>  "))((" 

// Notes

// Assertion messages may be unclear about what they display in some languages. If you read "...It Should encode XXX", the "XXX" is the expected result, not the input!

// Trolls are attacking your comment section!

// A common way to deal with this situation is to remove all of the vowels from the trolls' comments, neutralizing the threat.

// Your task is to write a function that takes a string and return a new string with all vowels removed.

// For example, the string "This website is for losers LOL!" would become "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!".

// Note: for this kata y isn't considered a vowel.

function disemvowel(str) {
  return str.split('')
            .filter(element => !'aeiou'.includes(element.toLowerCase()))
            .join('');

// 8 kyu - Count by X
// Create a function with two arguments that will return an array of the first (n) multiples of (x).

// Assume both the given number and the number of times to count will be positive numbers greater than 0.

// Return the results as an array (or list in Python, Haskell or Elixir).

// Examples:

// countBy(1,10) === [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
// countBy(2,5) === [2,4,6,8,10]

function countBy(x, n) {
  let z = [];
  for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    z.push(x * i)
  }
  return z;
}

// 8kyu - Will there be enough space?
// The Story:

// Bob is working as a bus driver. However, he has become extremely popular amongst the city's residents. With so many passengers wanting to get aboard his bus, he sometimes has to face the problem of not enough space left on the bus! He wants you to write a simple program telling him if he will be able to fit all the passengers.
// Task Overview:

// You have to write a function that accepts three parameters:

//     cap is the amount of people the bus can hold excluding the driver.
//     on is the number of people on the bus excluding the driver.
//     wait is the number of people waiting to get on to the bus excluding the driver.

// If there is enough space, return 0, and if there isn't, return the number of passengers he can't take.
// Usage Examples:

// cap = 10, on = 5, wait = 5 --> 0 # He can fit all 5 passengers
// cap = 100, on = 60, wait = 50 --> 10 # He can't fit 10 of the 50 waiting

function enough(cap, on, wait) {
  // your code here
  return (on + wait <= cap) ? 0 : (on + wait) - cap
}

// 6 kyu Your order, please

// Your task is to sort a given string. Each word in the string will contain a single number. This number is the position the word should have in the result.

// Note: Numbers can be from 1 to 9. So 1 will be the first word (not 0).

// If the input string is empty, return an empty string. The words in the input String will only contain valid consecutive numbers.
// Examples

// "is2 Thi1s T4est 3a"  -->  "Thi1s is2 3a T4est"
// "4of Fo1r pe6ople g3ood th5e the2"  -->  "Fo1r the2 g3ood 4of th5e pe6ople"
// ""  -->  ""

function order(words){
  // ...
  const extractNumber = (num) => num.split('').filter(letter => !isNaN(parseInt(letter)))
  return words.split(' ')
              .sort((a, b) => extractNumber(a) - extractNumber(b))
  						.join(' ')
}

// 8 kyu Sum of positive
// You get an array of numbers, return the sum of all of the positives ones.

// Example [1,-4,7,12] => 1 + 7 + 12 = 20

// Note: if there is nothing to sum, the sum is default to 0.

function positiveSum(arr) {
  return arr.filter(e => e > 0)
            .reduce((p, c) => p + c, 0)
}
